summary: Learn about the disinformation targeting plural systems, what the truth is, and how it can be harmful.
---

As of this writing, the plural community is often subject to discrimination based on disinformation, including between
the systems that are part of it.

We believe that the best way to combat disinformation is through education.
This article contains several common pieces of disinformation, and explores the truths that disprove them.

# Danger

Popular media tends to portray various forms of plurality as inherently dangerous.
While this trope isn't always harmful, seemingly many folks have trouble separating fictional media from reality,
and this has resulted in discrimination aimed at real-life plural systems.

Some examples of poor plural representation include:

- [_The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll_ (1960)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Faces_of_Dr._Jekyll) is a classic
  British horror film based on the 1886 novella, "Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde".
  In this adaption, Hyde emerges when Jekyll tests an experimental drug on himself.
  Portrayed as an alter-ego, Hyde commits a string of murders and frames Jekyll for his crimes, knowing Jekyll will
  have to give up control of the body to Hyde to avoid becoming a hunted fugitive.
- [_Split_ (2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_(2016_American_film)) is an American psychological thriller film,
  criticised by some mental health advocates for its stigmatization of neurodivergent disorders.
  The antagonist is Kevin, a man diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder.
  The story follows the actions of some of his headmates, who engage in sexual harassment, kidnapping, murder, and
  cannibalism.
- [_Nightmare Reaper_ (2022)](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Nightmare_Reaper) is a first-person shooter video
  game, where the player character is one of a series of headmates that have been in control of a girl known as "the
  patient".
  Late into the game, you learn that your character exists to fight the other headmates in the patient's system, with
  the goal of freeing an "innocent little girl", the "original" headmate.
  The game also tells you that "the patient" is guilty of a string of murders, caused by her mental state, and that
  the root of everything is severe childhood trauma.

As is probably clear from the descriptions, these are examples of fictional representations.
The reality is that most members of plural systems are just like anyone else.
In fact, reports like [this one from 2017](https://bpded.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40479-017-0053-9) show that
one cannot correlate dissociative disorders with criminal behaviour, and folks suffering from dissociative disorders
are often the subjects of violent crimes, rather than the perpetrators.

It is important to recognise when you have an internalised bias based on this form of disinformation, and to avoid
letting it cloud your judgement when interacting with plural systems.

# Disorder

While many folks only think of plurality in the context of mental disorders, many non-disordered systems exist.
[The DSM-5](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm) defines a disorder as follows:

> A _mental disorder_ is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition,
> emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental
> processes underlying mental functioning.
> Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other
> important activities.

Many systems simply don't meet this definition.
Some don't experience negative effects from their plurality, while others experience positive effects through a
symbiotic relationship with their headmates.

It is important to avoid making assumptions about plural systems.
Instead, you should talk with them and show an interest in learning about and understanding their unique experiences.

# Medicalisation

As with many psychological states, it is important not to medicalise plurality.
While it is true some systems will need therapy and other support from medical professionals, this will not be the case
for many.
Indeed, many members of the plural community believe in self-diagnosis, and many approaches exist to aid with this.

It is important to understand that you can’t force anyone into seeking therapy, even if you think they need it.
This is not just rude — it is actively harmful, and will make the plural systems around you feel uncomfortable and
unsafe.

Above almost everything, finding community tends to be helpful and therapeutic for plural systems.
[This report from 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5468408/) supports this, as does

# Recency & Visibility

A relatively common misconception is that the concept of plurality is new, and some blame the rise in self-identified
plural systems on the so-called "TikTok generation".
However, this couldn't be further from the truth.

As pointed out by [this research paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard-Loewenstein/publication/292985331_Dissociative_Disorders/links/56b41a3108ae5deb2657ec30/Dissociative-Disorders.pdf),
a 1646 medical report of a potential plurality was the first known, written by Paracelsus.
Eberhard Gmelin described another potential instance in 1791.
By the early 19th century, such cases were becoming more common, with regular reports on both sides of the Atlantic.

As acceptance for minority groups grows, those minorities feel more comfortable openly expressing themselves and
talking about their experiences.
The following graph often neatly illustrates this effect:

<div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 50rem;">

[![Graph showing the reported rate of left-handedness grew alongside acceptance.](/images/graphs/left-handed.png)](/images/graphs/left-handed.png)

</div>

Left-handedness isn't a trend or "social contagion", left-handed folks have always existed, and we simply stopped
forcing folks to be right-handed.
As acceptance grew, left-handed folks felt safe to be themselves and stopped hiding.
The same is true for many minority groups, including plural folk.
