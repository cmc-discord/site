summary: Learn about the disinformation targeting plural systems, what the truth is, and how it can be harmful.

As of this writing, the plural community is often subject to discrimination based on disinformation, including between
the systems that are part of it.

We believe that the best way to combat disinformation is through education.
This article contains several common pieces of disinformation, and explores the truths that disprove them.

# Danger

Popular media tends to portray various forms of plurality as inherently dangerous.
While this trope isn't always harmful, seemingly many people have trouble separating fictional media from reality,
and this has resulted in discrimination aimed at real-life plural systems.

Some examples of poor plural representation include:

- [_The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll_ (1960)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Faces_of_Dr._Jekyll) is a classic
  British horror film based on the 1886 novella, "Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde".
  In this adaption, Hyde emerges when Jekyll tests an experimental drug on himself.
  Portrayed as an alter-ego, Hyde commits a string of murders and frames Jekyll for his crimes, knowing Jekyll will
  have to give up control of the body to Hyde to avoid becoming a hunted fugitive.
- [_Split_ (2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_(2016_American_film)) is an American psychological thriller film,
  criticised by some mental health advocates for its stigmatization of neurodivergent disorders.
  The antagonist is Kevin, a man diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder.
  The story follows the actions of some of his headmates, who engage in sexual harassment, kidnapping, murder, and
  cannibalism.
- [_Nightmare Reaper_ (2022)](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Nightmare_Reaper) is a first-person shooter video
  game, where the player character is one of a series of headmates that have been in control of a girl known as "the
  patient".
  Late into the game, you learn that your character exists to fight the other headmates in the patient's system, with
  the goal of freeing an "innocent little girl", the "original" headmate.
  The game also tells you that "the patient" is guilty of a string of murders, caused by her mental state, and that
  the root of everything is severe childhood trauma.

As is probably clear from the descriptions, these are examples of fictional representations.
The reality is that most members of plural systems are just like anyone else.
In fact, reports like [this one from 2017](https://bpded.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40479-017-0053-9) show that
one cannot correlate dissociative disorders with criminal behaviour, and people suffering from dissociative disorders
are often the subjects of violent crimes, rather than the perpetrators.

It is important to recognise when you have an internalised bias based on this form of disinformation, and to avoid
letting it cloud your judgement when working with plural systems.
