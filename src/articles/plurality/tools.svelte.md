summary: Common tools used in plural communities and quality of life features.
---

In plural communities tools such as bots, mobile apps and similar are often used
for making their system easier to manage or allowing different members of systems
to communicate easier. Below you can find some commonly used tools on platforms
such as Discord, as well as apps some systems use to easier manage. These tools
are fairly common place in plural-accepting communities, however their use in
communities which are either unaware of plurality as a whole or don't cater to
systems specifically usually lack the quality of life tools most use.

# Discord Bots

- [PluralKit](http://pluralkit.me/) is the go-to Discord bot for plural systems,
  allowing system members to interact as themselves via Discord webhooks,
  however this can add some friction to discussions as messages move around,
  this is the only realistic option for plural systems to interact
  authentically.
- [Proxyfox](https://proxyfox.dev/) was a Discord bot designed to specifically
  tailor plural systems, it was created by a small team as an opwn source
  alternative to PluralKit, however as of March 1st, 2024 the bot has since been
  shut down. It should be noted it is possible to host the bot yourself.
- [Tupperbox](https://tupperbox.app/) is a bot mainly tailored to roleplaying
  communities. It also has a lot of problems such as a permissions system to
  limit the use to "genuine" plural systems. It also doesn't allow more than one
  account to be linked to the system at a time.

# Mobile Apps

- [Simply Plural](https://app.apparyllis.com) is a mobile and web app that
  allows systems to keep track of their members, who is fronting, how long each
  member is fronting and more. It goes as in depth as allowing sub systems, and
  is generally a useful tool to have outside of Discord communities.

# Other Tools

- [Pronouns.cc](https://pronouns.cc) is a pronoun page alternative to
  pronouns.page which specifically has the option to add "sub members" to your
  page, allowing plural systems to list their members, as well as information
  about them with ease.
