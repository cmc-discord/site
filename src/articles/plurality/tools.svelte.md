summary: Accessibility tooling for plural systems, and tools for system management.
---

Social media platforms rarely account for plural systems, and interacting authentically can be challenging.
In many plural communities, accessibility tooling exists to help with plural system management or to allow individual
system members to interact individually and authentically.

There exists software and other tooling to help plural systems keep track of their switches, maintain member profiles,
and otherwise keep their systems healthy.

# Social Tools

Plural systems commonly use the following tools to enhance their social media experience, to feel more comfortable, and
to allow them to be themselves.

## Discord

- [PluralKit](http://pluralkit.me/) is the most popular Discord bot for plural systems.
  Designed to allow plural systems to interact authentically, this bot provides a full suite of tools for managing one's
  system and interacting with others as an individual system member.

  Due to Discord limitations, this bot uses webhooks, which may cause messages to jump around as the bot deletes and
  reposts them.

  [You may self-host PluralKit if required](https://github.com/PluralKit/PluralKit#running), but this is
  inconvenient for systems in your spaces as they will need to duplicate their settings for your version.

  Some alternatives to PluralKit exist:

  - [ProxyFox](https://github.com/The-ProxyFox-Group/ProxyFox) is a PluralKit alternative, intended to provide a modern
    alternative experience for plural systems, in a bot that's easier to self-host than PluralKit.

    As of this writing, the ProxyFox maintainer has put the project on indefinite hold due to financial and health
    issues.
    However, the project is looking for maintainers and a new leader,
    and its [open-source licence](https://github.com/The-ProxyFox-Group/ProxyFox/blob/master/LICENSE) means someone may
    fork and continue it.

  - [Tupperbox](https://tupperbox.app/) can work in a pinch, for communities already using it.
    However, Tupperbox is a role-playing and RPG bot, and includes some features that are harmful to the plural
    community, such as the ability to gatekeep who has access to it.

    We recommend using a bot designed for plural systems instead of Tupperbox, where possible.


# Personal Tools

Plural systems commonly use the following tools to keep their systems organised, keep track of switches, create a
public profile, and for other purposes.

- [Lighthouse](https://www.writelighthouse.com/) is a journaling site designed for plural systems.
  It allows systems to write system-accessible and private, password-protected journals, as well as providing trauma
  worksheets and space to write about inner worlds.

- [pronouns.cc](https://pronouns.cc) is one of several sites allowing users to display information about their gender
  and pronouns, along with preferred names and terms.
  This site includes support for adding "sub-members" to your profile, allowing plural systems to easily list their
  members and information about them.

- [Simply Plural](https://apparyllis.com/) for Android, iOS and Web is a piece of software designed to allow systems
  to keep track of their members and switches, who is fronting and for how long, and more.
  It supports nested systems (also known as subsystems; plural systems within plural systems),
  sharing, and several other advanced features.
