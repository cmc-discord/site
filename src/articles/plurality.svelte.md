# Basic Information

Plurality, also known as multiplicity, is the existence of multiple self-aware
entities in a single brain. It's a concept that stems from dissassociative
disorders such as Disassociative Identity Disorder (DID) and Other Specified
Disassocitive Disorder (OSDD) as specified by the DSM 5 |cite: 10.1176/appi.books.9780890425787|
but there are many other situations that can cause things like this to happen,
the existence of plurality is in itself **not** problematic or negative.

Usually a group of plural entities is known as a **plural system** or simply
just a **system**. _When interacting with plural entities, remember to treat
each individual member of a plural system with respect._ Do not pathologize
their individual identities by for example asking to meet the "real" person or
suggesting they need to be "fixed" or "cured." Each member of a system can have
their own experiences, memories, and personality. If they ask to be treated a
certain way, respect their wish.

It is also worth mentioning that plurality is a very complex subject and is not
very well understood. Plural systems greatly differ from eacah other, they can
manifest and identify themselves in an unlimited amount of ways. All plural
systems are valid regardless of their origin, expression, or identity.
