# Basic Information

Plurality, occasionally known as multiplicity, is the existence of multiple self-aware entities in a single brain.

Folks often associate plurality with dissociative disorders like
[DID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder) and
[OSDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_specified_dissociative_disorder).
However, many pluralities are non-disordered, and they aren't necessarily problematic or negative.

Plural systems may experience amnesia-like symptoms, but this is not a universal rule, and many systems don't.

Generally, a grouping of plural entities is known as a _plural system_, or just a _system_.
A single plural entity in a system is known as a _headmate_, or a _system member_.

When interacting with members of plural systems, it is crucial you **treat each one with respect and understand that
they're their own unique individuals**.
Do not pathologise or medicalise their system, suggest they need to be "fixed" or "cured", or ask to speak with the
"real" person.
Additionally, system members often have their own experiences, memories, and personalities.
If they ask to be treated a certain way, it is important you respect their wish.

It is also worth noting that pluralities can be very complex, and we still lack in-depth research and understanding on
how plural systems work, or where they come from.

Plural systems differ greatly from each other, and they may manifest and identify themselves in an infinite number of
ways.
All plural systems are valid, regardless of their origins, expression, or identity.
