# Basic Information

This website aims to be a one-stop shop for anyone who helps to maintain a community space,
whether their focus is on community management, moderation, or advising other members of their staff team.
The Community Management Community (_The CMC_), a group of moderators and community managers with a wish to improve how
everyone runs their community spaces, maintains the site.

<!--more-->

The CMC believes in the strength of diverse viewpoints, and prioritises the safety of minority groups in its work.
We believe it is impossible to run a truly healthy community without catering for a diverse member base, and we aim
to prove that diverse spaces are a positive for everyone.

We also believe that collaboration is key, and members of the CMC worked together to contribute the content on this
site, and we've licensed all of this content under the
[Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

The CMC is not ready to onboard new members as of this writing.
However, we're working on setting up a proper community space and onboarding process.
We'll share details about this here soon!

# Website Structure

We've designed a tagging system for this site's content, instead of a traditional tree of links.
This is largely because it is challenging to define a logical tree structure for the article-style content this site
was intended for.

For this reason, we provide multiple ways to find what you're looking for:

- The [All Tags page](/tags), which you can use to browse all of this site's content.
  You can also click on the tags shown in an article's header to navigate to that tag's listing page.
- The [search page](/search), which you can use to filter the site's articles and find exactly what you're looking for.
- The [home page](/), which provides a selection of recommended tags and articles for your reading.

If you have any ideas on how to potentially improve the site navigation, or any feedback at all, please contact us!
