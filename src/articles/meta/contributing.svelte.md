This website was primarily built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), itself built
using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).
Svelte is a component-based frontend framework, designed to compile its components to specialised code that manipulates
the DOM directly, minimising the size of the client bundle and producing a more efficient result.

We've tried to create understandable articles to document the project and how you should contribute to it.
If you feel like this section needs improvement, please feel free to contact us or
[submit a Pull Request](/a/meta/contributing/submission).
