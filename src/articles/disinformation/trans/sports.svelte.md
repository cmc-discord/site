The discussion regarding whether we should include trans folks in our sports (and how to categorise them) is
long-running and divisive.
Before we can get into the discussion proper, though, we'll need to talk about the history of sex-based segregation in
sports.

# Historical Segregation

It is a well-known fact that women's rights are a relatively recent concept, and that women have been (and continue
to be) discriminated against for much of humanity's history.
As pointed out by [Four Waves of Feminism](https://www.pacificu.edu/magazine/four-waves-feminism), the first
recognisable form of feminism (first-wave feminism) formally began in 1848.
In [What is First-Wave Feminism?](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/first-wave-feminism), MasterClass points out
that the beginnings of this movement focused on a defined set of grievances, regarding suffrage, government
representation, marriage and divorce laws, and employment.

As explained in [Sex Segregation in Sports](https://books.google.ie/books?id=-t3EEAAAQBAJ), as late as the 1970s, there
were few roles considered "gender appropriate" for women and girls.
Society expected them to focus on traditional (and low-wage if they were working) roles, such as cooking, cleaning,
home-making and cosmetology.
When organised sports appeared in the US in the 19th century, we discouraged or outright banned women and girls from
participating, resulting in sports largely being characterised as male-dominated and even hypermasculine, something
that persists today.

[Sex Segregation in Sports](https://books.google.ie/books?id=-t3EEAAAQBAJ) also explains that
[Title IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX), which prohibits sex-based discrimination in all government-funded
forms of education, was heavily contested by opponents who wished to restrict the rights of women in athletics,
lobbying to exclude it.
For example, the NCAA's executive director stated that Title IX was the "possible doom of intercollegiate sports", and
Senator John Tower (TX) proposed amendments to exclude women from revenue-generating sports.

As pointed out by Marion Müller in
[Constructing Gender Incommensurability in Competitive Sport](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24757601), the idea of
segregating sports by sex today relies on some assumption that women on average perform less well than men.
They explain that early big sport organisations tried to exclude women whose performances were above expectations, by
establishing "gender verifications" that accused those women of fraud.
This happened even though there was (and is) no scientific proof such segregation makes logical sense on any material
basis.

Müller's paper explores this topic in detail, and concludes that the thought process used to justify this segregation
was, in fact, a tool used by segregationists to try to prove that material differences existed.
It seems as if this form of segregation exists to prevent us from making direct comparisons between the performance of
the sexes in sports and athletics, which would prove beyond a doubt that there's no material difference.
In fact, the implementation of sex-based segregation in fencing, rifle shooting and skeet shooting only began after a
woman won against male competitors, implying that it only exists to reinforce masculine stereotypes.
This is [further explored by Julia Konieczny](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ijlse/vol8/iss1/3/), who relates
her experience as a young wrestler in an otherwise all-male wrestling team, and how opponents would forfeit once they
realised she was a girl.

Müller also points out that when decades of attempts to prove that women performed less well than men at sports failed,
sports organisations tried to find new reasons to continue to segregate sports by sex.
We can see examples of this in the media as recently as 2023, when
[Olympic medallist Caster Semenya won a court case](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/human-rights-court-rules-in-favor-of-olympic-champion-semenya-over-testosterone-rules)
that declared it was discriminatory for World Athletics to exclude her based on her natural testosterone levels.

While racism isn't the focus of this article, it is also worth noting that
[the regulations on testosterone levels are likely racist](https://www.allure.com/story/caster-semenya-ruling-op-ed).
This is partly because black women often have their femininity denied by racists, and many believe the regulations only
used white women's testosterone levels as a guideline.

# Trans Segregation

Müller concludes that sports organisations tend to see gender ambiguity (which may be challenging to categorise) as
a threat.
They further attempt to justify their segregation by measuring "hyperandrogenism", or heightened levels of testosterone,
excluding women that produce more of it and don't go through medical treatments to lower it.
However, this only proves Müller's point — that this doesn't represent a meaningful difference in performance.
Instead, it is simply an extension of institutions' wish to continue to segregate sports by sex, apparently in an appeal
to traditional values.

This train of thought also affects trans people, sometimes in contradictory ways.
People who believe in
[biological essentialism](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095507973) may state
that one's biology defines much of their sporting ability, stating that trans-feminine folks have an innate
physical advantage due to being born male.
As the big sports organisations use testosterone as a measure of "maleness," it is unsurprising those who support
excluding trans-feminine people from organised sports use the heightened testosterone levels of people assigned male at
birth as a justification.
These people also usually ignore trans-masculine people, a group that tends to contradict many of their arguments.

Firstly, the assumption that testosterone has a measurable effect on the performance of an athlete has, as of this
writing, no scientific basis whatsoever:

- According to [this report published by Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89232-1), testosterone does
  not affect lean mass or hand grip strength in women.
- [This report commissioned by the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport](https://www.cces.ca/sites/default/files/content/docs/pdf/transgenderwomenathletesandelitesport-ascientificreview-e-final.pdf),
  a comprehensive review of all relevant, English language scientific literature published between 2011 and 2021, states
  that there's no evidence that including trans-feminine people in sport would be unfair.
- [A 2019 investigation into the testosterone regulations](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40318-019-00143-w)
  shows that the regulations were justified using significantly flawed data, and that the data, when corrected,
  contradicts the conclusion that the IAAF put forward.

  It also points out that the IAAF neglected to have their research peer-reviewed, and it contained a significant
  number of basic errors, such as duplicated athletes.

Secondly, while not all trans-feminine folks will, many of them do decide to undergo
[hormone replacement therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_hormone_therapy), or HRT.
HRT is a form of hormone therapy, which involves the administering of hormonal medications to help align trans folks'
secondary sexual characteristics with their gender.
This medication usually takes two forms, typically administered together:

- Hormone blockers, which lower the production of a given hormone or inhibit the receptors for that hormone.
- Medication providing supplemental hormones, matching the trans folk's gender and keeping their hormonal balance
  healthy.

For pre-surgery trans-feminine folks, this medication will typically lower their testosterone levels and raise their
oestrogen levels.
This would imply that any potentially measurable benefits granted by their prior testosterone levels would become
nullified through their medical treatment.

Here's what the science has to say:

- [This report from 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8311086/) shows that feminizing HRT does lower
  strength, haemoglobin levels, muscle area and lean body mass.
  It suggests that trans-feminine people may have similar physical characteristics to cisgender women after three years,
  but also recommends further research.
- [This 2024 report](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/109/2/e455/7223439) shows that masculinising HRT in
  non-athletic trans-masculine folks results in a performance level no different to cisgender men after 1 to 3 years.
  It also shows that feminizing HRT results in bone density compromise, and after 4 years, their muscle and fat mass,
  and performance is no different to that of cisgender women.
  Like the previous study, it recommends further research.

While studies opine that trans-feminine people may generally retain some minor long-term advantages over cisgender
women, competitive sports organisations already accept and account for similar deviations in abilities and advantages
in cisgender women.
[The report from the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport](https://www.cces.ca/sites/default/files/content/docs/pdf/transgenderwomenathletesandelitesport-ascientificreview-e-final.pdf)
also points this out.

Thirdly, while advocates for banning trans folks from sports often use children as a talking point, claims that banning
trans children from sports is an issue of protecting other children seem nebulous at best:

- [According to the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/lawmakers-unable-to-cite-local-trans-girls-sports-914a982545e943ecc1e265e8c41042e7),
  lawmakers have largely been unable to cite local examples of trans girls competing in sports.
  Where examples are available, there appears to be no evidence that including trans children results in competitive
  unfairness.
- As Susanna Cassisa points out in [this Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/made-by-history/2023/07/24/groomer-lgbtq-germany-children/),
  the "protect the children" rhetoric has been used to demonise members of the LGBT+ community since the early 1900s,
  and potentially even earlier than that.

Finally, advocates for banning trans folks from sports often include non-physical sports, coming up with the same
conclusions.
This suggests that this is more about transphobia and misogyny than any idea of fairness:

- [This report from 2022](https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/62821241) talks about a trans-feminine snooker player,
  and the harassment she faced after her tournament win.
  This included calls from former world number one Maria Catalano, who called for trans players to be banned from
  women's tournaments.
- [This report from 2023](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/18/1194593562/chess-transgender-fide-pushback) talks about how
  the International Chess Federation (FIDE) effectively declared that women are less intelligent than men.
  It effectively banned trans women from competing in women's competitions for up to two years, and decided to remove
  some titles won by both trans men and women in their respective categories.
- [This report from 2024](https://www.bbc.com/sport/wales/68183503) talks about how professional pool player
  Lynne Pinches turned down her first ever professional contract, when the World Eightball Pool Federation reversed its
  ban on trans players.
- [This report from 2024](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240325-dutch-women-s-darts-veterans-quit-over-transgender-team-mate)
  talks about how several Dutch cisgendered women's darts veterans quit when they realised their team included a trans
  woman, complaining about fairness in the sport.

# Conclusion

While further research is necessary to fully understand the effects of transitioning on one's body, the above context
shows that there's no real reason to exclude trans folks from sports.
Indeed, the scientific evidence seems to contradict every argument made in support of banning trans folks, and it
also seems that many advocates for that aren't arguing based on any reasonable or factual basis.

While it is impossible for any article to be absolutely inclusive of all possible information, we believe that the
context we've provided above shows that there's no reasonable basis for excluding trans folks from sport.
