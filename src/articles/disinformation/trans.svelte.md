# Foreword

As of this writing, many people (and governments) are hostile towards the trans community.
Fuelling much of this hate is an ocean of disinformation, largely relying on a few key lies or misrepresentations.

We believe the best way to combat this disinformation is through education.
This article contains all our research on relevant disinformation to date.

<Alert.Description>

Before you engage someone repeating disinformation, you should think about the following points:

- **Are they a figurehead?** You'll find it hard to dissuade people creating disinformation, or those who use it to
  make a living or remain culturally relevant.
- **Do they seem interested in learning?** As the adage goes, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it
  drink.
  You'll find it hard to educate people who don't wish to be educated.
- **How indoctrinated are they?** Some people will expect your rebuttal.
  Groups exist that try to indoctrinate and radicalise people, and deprogramming them often requires more
  time and effort than any one person can put in.
- **Do they rely on contradictions?** A surprising amount of anti-trans rhetoric is self-contradictory.
  This type of disinformation exists to try to take advantage of
  [phantasms](https://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S434.htm), and a simple rebuttal won't help much.
  After all, the contradiction is the point!

Remember to prioritise your safety, energy and mental health before engaging, and expect to receive harassment if
you do this in a public online space.
